# Mets-Pitching-Data
This was the final project for IST 707. 

My group chose to use a dataset comprised of ~32,000 pitches from five Mets pitchers across three seasons. Each pitch had 89 attributes.
The data came from Baseball Savant which is the system that feeds Stat Cast. 

We were tasked with using data mining techniques to analyze this data and draw conclusions that would be helpful to the Mets' pitching staff. 
After performing out initial data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, we used k-means clustering to cluster the data, Naive-Bayes models to predict whether a batter would swing at a specific pitch, SVMs to predict fastballs or off-speed pitches, and association rule mining to gather rules for certain situations. 

Note: The clustering analysis was conducted largely in Weka so the Rmd in this project is mostly data cleaning and prep for Weka. 

Each group member took certain parts of the project to work on and complete. Credit is attributed in the separate code files for each model. 

A huge thank you to Charlie for putting together the format for the final paper and Sam for putting together our PowerPoint.
